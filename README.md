# Employee-Tracker

For this assignmentt, we were required to track employee through the command line. The user will be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company so they can organise and plan their business. 
Once they run node server in the comand line, the following options will appear:
view employee, roles, and departments. Then, they can add departments,roles and employees, or update one them. When they're done they can see the results and after that exit the app if they're satisfied with their choices.
